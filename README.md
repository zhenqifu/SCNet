You can run eval.py and to obtain the results using our pre-trained model [[Baidu Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1sQ_j-6A7EhNPJF7r9KWsRw)(9xwn)] [[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kHOPSUObw7FafI6_xgaD9kCZ5U5JzIsc/view?usp=sharing)].

You can run get_performance.py to obtian the SSIM, PSNR and LPIPS scores.

To train the model, you need to prepare the dataset first [[Baidu Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1LNh4XjePRw96-Jh-IDOkHw)(qwat)] [[(Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DBCXCa5GWJPB7S6xO7f0N562FqXhsV6c/view?usp=sharing)]. Then, run main.py.
