# SCNet
Underwater Image Enhancement via Learning Water Type Desensitized Representations. Accepted by ICASSP 2022. [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00676)]

You can run eval.py and to obtain the results using our pre-trained model [Baidu Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1sQ_j-6A7EhNPJF7r9KWsRw)(9xwn) [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kHOPSUObw7FafI6_xgaD9kCZ5U5JzIsc/view?usp=sharing).

You can run get_performance.py to obtian the SSIM, PSNR and LPIPS scores.

To train the model, you need to prepare the dataset [Baidu Drive](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1LNh4XjePRw96-Jh-IDOkHw)(qwat) [(Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DBCXCa5GWJPB7S6xO7f0N562FqXhsV6c/view?usp=sharing) first. Then, run main.py.
